The idea is to model the series of binary digits as a curve and keep track of
the current total.

For instance, given the sequence 0 0 0 0 1 1

    Every time we have a 0, we decrement our current total.
    Every time we have a 1, we increment our current total.

    Digit   | Total
    ---------------
    0       | -1
    0       | -2        <---------------|
    0       | -3        <-|             |
    0       | -4          | Balanced    | Balanced 
    1       | -3        <-|             |
    1       | -2        <---------------|

What we can observe is that anytime we return to a previous total, we have gone
through a balanced series of ups and downs (increments and decrements, 0's and
1's).

Therefore, our strategy is to iterate through our sequence of digits, track the
current total, and check if we have ever seen the current total before.  If we
have, then we can compute the length of the series of ups and downs (ie. number
of balanced digits) by subtracting the first time we have seen this length with
our current index.  We then can compare this length to our current maximum
length and update it appropriately.

        # If we have seen this current total before, then we have found a
